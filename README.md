# 🗣️ Tamil Dialect Standardization Model

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to **convert colloquial Tamil speech from the Nellai (Tirunelveli) dialect into standardized Senthamizh (pure Tamil)**. It is designed to promote regional language accessibility, improve linguistic clarity in communication, and support natural language understanding in AI systems.

- 🎯 **Input**: Spoken Tamil in Nellai slang  
- 🎯 **Output**: Spoken Senthamizh (Pure Tamil)  
- 🎙️ **Mode**: Speech-to-speech transformation  
- 🧠 **Model**: Sequence-to-sequence Transformer / mT5 (Multilingual T5)
